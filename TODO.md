# TODO List

### Network

##### Bloom Filters

This reduces query traffic by not sending last hop queries to peers that definitely do not have the file

##### Two-tier Topology

This helps with scalability

### Core

* Metadata parsing and search
* Automatic adjustment of number of I2P tunnels
* Persist trust immediately
* Check if user-selected download and incomplete locations exist and are writeable
* Enum i18n
* Ability to share trust list only with trusted users
* Confidential files visible only to certain users
* Advertise file feed and browseability in upload headers
* Download queue with priorities 

### Chat
* echo "unknown/innappropriate command" in the console
* break up lines on CR/LF, send multiple messages
* Style timestamps and persona names
* enforce # in room names or ignore it
* auto-create/join channel on server start
* jump from notification window to room with message

### Swing GUI
* I2P Status panel - display message when connected to external router
* Search box - left identation
* Ability to disable switching of tabs on actions
* Ability to trust/browse/subscribe from uploads tab

### Web UI/Plugin
* HTML 5 media players
* Remove versions from jar names
* Security: POST nonces, CSP headers
* Upload files from browser to plugin via drag-and-drop
* Check permissions, display better errors when sharing local folders
